# mcstatus-cvn

This is just a small wrapper by canvon around Dinnerbone's `mcstatus`
python library, as found per <https://github.com/Dinnerbone/mcstatus>,
`v6.4.0`.

This wrapper is there so that I (canvon) can keep a loop running
to see who last used our Minecraft server (and when and how long).
